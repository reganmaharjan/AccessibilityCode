I'll create a concise README that explains what we built. Let me create a README.md file:

Perfect! I've created a concise README that explains what we built. Here's a summary:

## ðŸ“‹ **What We Accomplished**

### **Main Achievement:**
Built a **WCAG 2.1 AA compliant rich text editor** with full keyboard accessibility

### **Key Solutions:**
1. **Custom Accessible Toolbar** - Replaced Trix's built-in toolbar with our own fully keyboard-accessible version
2. **Complete Keyboard Navigation** - Tab, Arrow keys, Enter/Space activation
3. **Screen Reader Support** - ARIA labels, live announcements, semantic HTML
4. **Visual Accessibility** - Focus indicators, color contrast, reduced motion support

### **Technical Approach:**
- Used `document.execCommand()` for reliable formatting
- Disabled Trix's built-in toolbar to avoid conflicts
- Implemented comprehensive event handling for both keyboard and mouse users
- Added proper ARIA roles and live regions for assistive technology

### **Result:**
A fully functional, accessible rich text editor that serves as a **reference implementation** for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance in rich text editing interfaces.

The README provides a clear overview for anyone who wants to understand what we built and why we chose this approach over using Trix's default toolbar.
